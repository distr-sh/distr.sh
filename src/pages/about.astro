        Distr is built by a team with years of hands-on experience in software
        distribution, Kubernetes operations, and production-grade
        infrastructure.

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        We have worked extensively with modern deployment architectures across
        cloud, hybrid, and on-premise environments. From Kubernetes-based
        platforms to Docker Compose setups and regulated enterprise
        environments, our background is rooted in solving real-world deployment
        challenges at scale.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Over the years, we have helped organizations design, deploy, and operate
        secure, highly available software delivery systems. Our experience
        spans:
      </p>

      <ul
        class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        <li>Kubernetes-native deployments</li>
        <li>High-availability, multi-cluster enterprise architectures</li>
        <li>OCI container registries and artifact management</li>
        <li>Secure on-premise and air-gapped installations</li>
        <li>BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) environments</li>
        <li>Enterprise-grade authentication and access control</li>
        <li>Deployment observability and operational monitoring</li>
        <li>Data privacy and information security best practices</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Security and reliability are foundational to how we build. We understand
        the requirements of organizations operating in regulated industries,
        including strict data privacy policies, internal security reviews, and
        compliance-driven infrastructure constraints. Our experience includes
        designing systems with:
      </p>

      <ul
        class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        <li>Strong isolation between customer environments</li>
        <li>Role-based access control and auditability</li>
        <li>Secure artifact distribution</li>
        <li>Version traceability and rollback guarantees</li>
        <li>
          Redundancy and failover strategies for business-critical systems
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Distr reflects this operational background. It is designed with
        production realities in mind: compliance considerations, secure
        defaults, operational resilience, and long-term maintainability.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Our team has been building and operating
        infrastructure platforms for years, working with fast-growing startups
        as well as large enterprises across multiple industries. Organizations
        trust our tooling to manage critical software distribution workflows in
        environments where uptime, security, and control are non-negotiable.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Our focus is pragmatic:</h2>
      <ul
        class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        <li>Make deployments predictable</li>
        <li>Make distribution secure</li>
        <li>Make infrastructure resilient</li>
        <li>Make operations observable</li>
        <li>Make customer environments manageable</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Distr is developed and maintained by engineers who have lived through
        real-world operational edge cases — failed rollouts, scaling
        bottlenecks, compliance audits, cluster outages, registry failures, and
        complex multi-tenant enterprise environments. The platform is shaped by
        that experience.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        We continue to invest in long-term stability, security, and enterprise
        readiness. Our goal is to provide infrastructure teams with a dependable
        foundation for distributing and managing software across cloud, hybrid,
        and on-premise environments — with data protection, availability, and
        operational control built in from the start.
