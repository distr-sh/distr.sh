Alerts notify selected users by email when a monitored deployment becomes unhealthy.
This covers scenarios like failed updates, lost agent connectivity, container crashes, or status transitions to **Stale** or **Error**.

<Aside type="note">
  Alerts apply only to [agent-based deployments](/docs/product/agents/) and are
  not available for [registry-only usage](/docs/product/registry/). Alerts are a
  **Pro feature** and require a [Pro subscription](/pricing/).
</Aside>

## Vendor Alerts and Customer Alerts

By default, alerts are vendor-managed: you configure alert rules and choose who gets notified.

Under **Customers** in the [Vendor Portal](/docs/product/vendor-portal/), you can enable alert management per customer organization (see [Customer Management](/docs/guides/customer-management/)). This supports two scenarios:

**Vendor-managed deployments** — You monitor deployments and receive alerts directly, potentially before the customer notices an issue.

**Customer-managed deployments** — Customers configure their own alerts and choose who in their organization gets notified.

## How to Configure Alerts

In the sidebar, navigate to **Agents** > **Alerts**.

1. Click **Create alert configuration**.
2. Enter a name for the configuration.
3. Select one or more deployments to monitor.
4. Select the users who should receive email notifications.

The **Notification history** tab shows previously triggered alerts.

<Aside type="tip">
  If alert management is enabled for a customer organization (under
  [**Customers**](/docs/guides/customer-management/)), users in that
  organization follow the same steps from the [Customer
  Portal](/docs/product/customer-portal/).

## When Notifications Are Sent

An email notification is sent when a monitored deployment transitions from a healthy to a degraded state:

| From                       | To                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Running** or **Healthy** | **Stale** or **Error** |

A recovery notification is also sent when a deployment returns to a healthy state (**Running** or **Healthy**) after being degraded.

For the full list of deployment statuses, see [Deployment Health](/docs/product/agents/#deployment-health).
For details on how **Running** vs. **Healthy** is determined, see [Healthchecks](/docs/product/agents/#healthchecks).
